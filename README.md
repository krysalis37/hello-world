Hello, World!

I'm Krystal, but I also go by Krysalis. My pronouns are she/her.
My current coding languages I am learning are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I am also interested in learning Python. I like web development projects, but as a gamer, I am also interested in learning how to program games. I am an intellectual, creative, deep feeling type. I have multiple interests, and am terrible at small talk, as I find that incredibly boring. I'm relatively new to modern coding, and am coming in from a massage therapy career of 8 years.
